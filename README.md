Tuition Materials for Coding Project


## project set up / layout / website

website with icons that are links to each project
each icon will have title, description, list of skill required and perhaps an image

upon clicking on an icon, it will take you to a page with the project details
title, relevent image/diagrams, description, list of skills required; then the steps
maybe a short video to introduce the project and show the final product

each step are small, covering a single concept(skill), and help for student when stuck 
help can take the form of documentations, links to relevent websites, simpler examples, or even a video

each skill/concept will have a link to a page where the student can learn the concept/skill. 
That can be a video, or a document
something important with codeed is that we approach the problem from behind, we start with project
and teach the skills that are needed to complete the project. this way students learn to think like a programmer
